# DNA replication


## Ori
Biology tells us that all DNA uses **DNA Polymerase** to duplicate DNA before a cell splits.


DNA Polymerase uses a protein named **DNAA** to bind onto the existing DNA strand and begin replication

DNA Polymerase apparently looks for the replication point of a DNA strand in the form of a usually 9 molecules long DNA sequence, denominated the **DNAA Box**

Multiple DNAA proteins can bind to multiple if not all DNAA boxes

Experiments have shown that in order to bind the DNAA protein efficiently, **multiple instances of the DNA box should exist in proximity.**

The cluster in which multiple instances of a DNA box exist, is called the **Ori**, and it's believed to be the standard replication point of DNA.

## DNA binding

Why does DNA replication follow the 5' to 3' end rule? [Answer in this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=356&v=y4hKibS2fAo)

### Nucleotides
Wiki on [Nucleotides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide)

#### Double helix pairs of molecules :
- [Cytosine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytosine) && [Guanine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine)

- [Adenine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenine) && [Thymine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymine) || [Uracil (Thymine equivalent in RNA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uracil)

## RNA
Ribonucleic acid *aka* [RNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA) is a polymeric molecule that binds nucleotides together in a single chain (unlike the paired DNA chain)

While DNA features a Deoxyribose backbone, RNA presents a single ribose which gives it a more maleable chemical nature.

RNA also features Uracil instead of Thymine as the complementary basis of Adenine.

The only  structural difference between Uracil and Thymine, is that Uracil features one less CH3 molecule than Thymine. Should Uracil undergo a process of [Methylation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylation) it would present the exact same strucuture as Thymine
